#  LLM Project with Langchain Framework

Welcome to our Language Model (LLM) project using the Langchain framework! In this project, we are focused on building a robust question-and-answer system tailored for a real e-learning company. Unlike typical projects that rely on toy datasets, we're working with real-world data to ensure the system's effectiveness and practicality.

## About the Project

This project is designed to showcase the capabilities of Langchain in developing advanced AI applications, specifically in the realm of question answering within the e-learning domain. By leveraging Langchain, we aim to create an intuitive and efficient system that enhances the learning experience for users.
